# CYK-algorithm-with-all-possible-parse-trees

Given a Context Free Grammar in Chomsky Normal Form and an input string, the C++ code checks if the given string is accepted by the grammar. If yes, it prints all the possible parse trees even if the grammar is ambigous.

Files : 
1.  input.txt  -  Contains the CFG and input string in a specified format. 
2.  tcom.cpp   -  Contains the C++ code that runs on the input file and checks if the string is accepted by CFG. Also, by default it redirects all the possible parse trees and the count to the output.txt file.Currently, it prints the grammar and count of unique parse trees on the console, but can also be modified to print all the trees on console.
3.  output.txt -  Contains all the possible parse trees for the given configuration.
